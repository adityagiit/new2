  <h1>Hi, I'm Aditya ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a curious and creative web enthusiast based in Faridabad, India. I love crafting visually engaging digital experiences and solving layout puzzles with HTML and CSS. Whether it's debugging a tricky styling issue or designing a sleek GitHub bio, I bring both aesthetic flair and technical precision to everything I create.

    My journey into web development started with a fascination for how websites come to life. Since then, I've been diving deeper into front-end design, exploring DevTools, and learning how to manage npm packages and dependencies. I believe in building things that not only work well but look great too.

    When I'm not tweaking code or experimenting with new layouts, you'll find me exploring digital branding, curating background images, and finding creative ways to express ideas online.
